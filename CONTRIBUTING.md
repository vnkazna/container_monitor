# Contributing to GitLab Workflow

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GitLab Workflow! This guide details how to contribute
to this extension in a way that is easy for everyone. These are mostly guidelines, not rules.
Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a merge request.

## Code of Conduct

We want to create a welcoming environment for everyone who is interested in contributing. Visit our [Code of Conduct page](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/code-of-conduct/) to learn more about our commitment to an open and welcoming environment.

## Getting Started

### Reporting Issues

Create a [new issue from the "Bug" template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Bug) and follow the instructions in the template.

### Proposing Features

Create a [new issue from the "Feature Proposal" template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20Proposal) and follow the instructions in the template.

### Configuring Development Environment

For general information how to develop and debug VS Code Extensions, please see the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api).

The following instructions will help you run the GitLab Workflow Extension locally.

Please review our [Coding guidelines](docs/coding-guidelines.md) before writing new code.

#### Step - 1 : Installation Prerequisites

We're assuming that you already have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed along
with [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) installed
and configured, if not, do that first! If already done, proceed ahead.

*  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   *  Version is specified in [`.tool-versions`](.tool-versions))
   *  We use the same major node version as VS Code
   *  You can use [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/#/) to manage your node version
*  [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

#### Step - 2 : Fork and Clone

*  Use your GitLab account to [fork](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/forks/new) this project
    *  Don't know how forking works? Refer to [this guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/fork-project.html#doc-nav).
    *  Don't have GitLab account? [Create one](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in#register-pane)! It is free and it is awesome!
*  Visit your forked project (usually URL is `https://gitlab.com/<your user name>/gitlab-vscode-extension`) and copy
   SSH or HTTPS URL to clone the project into your system.
    *  Don't know how to clone a project? Refer to [this guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/command-line-commands.html#clone-your-project).

#### Step - 3 : Install dependencies

Once project is cloned, open terminal within the project folder and run following;

```bash
npm install
npm webview
```

This command will install all necessary dependencies to run and debug extension in developer mode.

#### Step - 4 : Running the extension

Open the extension project in VS Code (e.g. by running `code .` in the project folder).

You can run the extension in development mode by running `View: Show Run and Debug` command (using `cmd+shift+p`). And clicking the green play icon to start the extension.

You can read through the [Running and debugging your extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension#run-the-extension) section of the official documentation.

#### Step - 5 : Troubleshooting

Logs can be found by running `Developer: Show Logs ...` command (using `cmd+shift+p`) and selecting `Extension Host`.

You can always use debugger when you are running the extension in development mode.

#### Step - 6 : Run tests

To run tests, open terminal within the project folder and run following:

```bash
npm test
```

See also [how to write automated tests](docs/writing-tests.md).

#### Step - 7 : Run linter

To run linters, open terminal within the project folder and run following;

```bash
npm autofix # Automatically formats your code using prettier and fixes eslint errors
npm eslint
```

### Your First Contribution?

For newcomers to the project, you can take a look at issues labelled as `Accepting merge requests`
as available [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/issues?label_name[]=Accepting%20merge%20requests).

### Opening Merge Requests

Steps to opening a merge request to contribute code to GitLab Workflow is similar to any other open source project.
You develop in a separate branch of your own fork and the merge request should have a related issue open in the project.
Any Merge Request you wish to open in order to contribute to GitLab Workflow, be sure you have followed through the steps from [Configuring Development Environment](#configuring-development-environment).

In this project, we don't [close issues automatically when the MR gets merged](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically). Instead, we close the issues when the MR change is [released](docs/release-process.md). Please replace `Closes #<issueId>` in the MR description with `Relates to #<issueId>`.
