# Troubleshooting the GitLab extension

## Settings for self-signed certificates

To use self-signed certificates to connect to your GitLab instance, configure them using the following settings. These are community contributed because the GitLab team uses a public CA.

These settings don't work with [`http.proxy` setting for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/network#_legacy-proxy-server-support) (see [open issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/issues/314)).

**`gitlab.ca`** _(required: false, default: null)_

*Deprecated. Please see [the SSL setup guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/blob/main/docs/user/ssl.md) for more information on how to set up your self-signed CA.*

**`gitlab.cert`** _(required: false, default: null)_

**Unsupported** - See [&6244](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6244). *If your self-managed GitLab instance requires a custom cert/key pair you would probably need to set this option in to point your certificate file. Please also see `gitlab.certKey` option.*

**`gitlab.certKey`** _(required: false, default: null)_

**Unsupported** - See [&6244](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6244). *If your self-managed GitLab instance requires a custom cert/key pair you would probably need to set this option in to point your certificate key file. Please also see `gitlab.cert` option.*

**`gitlab.ignoreCertificateErrors`** _(required: false, default: false)_

**Unsupported** - See [&6244](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6244). *If you are using a self-managed GitLab instance with no SSL certificate or having certificate issues and unable to use the extension you may want to set this option to `true` to ignore certificate errors.*
