# Custom queries

You can define custom queries in your VS Code configuration by defining a search expression in
[`settings.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-file-locations).
These expressions create the list of items shown in the **Issues and Merge requests** section
of the [sidebar](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/README.md#sidebar) of Visual Studio code.

The default custom queries are defined in the
[extension package.json](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/blob/c3f029555a723964789ee0a855dede3f1b3b3af2/package.json#L578-614).
When you specify the `gitlab.customQueries` setting, your definition overrides all
the default queries. For example:

```json
{
  "gitlab.customQueries": [
    {
      "name": "Issues assigned to me",
      "type": "issues",
      "scope": "assigned_to_me",
      "noItemText": "There is no issue assigned to you.",
      "state": "opened"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each query is an entry of the JSON array. Depending on the type of entry you're querying,
the returned information can contain different types of values:

- [All query types](#for-all-queries)
- [Issues, epics, and merge requests](#issues-epics-and-merge-requests)
- [Vulnerability reports](#vulnerability-reports)

Snippets [don't support](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_snippets.html) any
query parameters.

## For all queries

These properties can be applied to any query type.

| Parameter    | Required | Default | Definition |

| `name`       | yes      | n/a | The label to show in the GitLab panel. |
| `noItemText` | no       | `No items found.` | The text to show if the query returns no items. |
| `type`       | no       | `merge_requests` | The type of GitLab items to return. If `snippets` is selected, none of the other filters work. Epics are available only on GitLab Ultimate (or Gold). Possible values: `issues`, `merge_requests`, `epics`, `snippets`, `vulnerabilities`. |

## Issues, epics, and merge requests

| Parameter       | Required | Default | Definition |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |

| `orderBy`       | no       | `created_at` | Return entities ordered by the selected value. Possible values: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `priority`, `due_date`, `relative_position`, `label_priority`, `milestone_due`, `popularity`, `weight`. Some values are specific to issues, and some to merge requests. Read [about listing merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/merge_requests.html#list-merge-requests) for more information. |
| `sort`          | no       | `desc` | Return issues sorted in ascending or descending order. Possible values: `asc`, `desc`. |

| `excludeLabels` | no       | `[]` | Array of label names GitLab item must not have to be returned. Predefined names are case-insensitive. Works only with issues. |

## Vulnerability reports

Vulnerability reports don't share
[any common query parameters](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/vulnerability_findings.html)
with other entry types. Each parameter listed in this table works with vulnerability reports only:

| Parameter | Required | Default | Definition |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `scope` | no | `dismissed` | Returns vulnerability findings for the given scope. Possible values: `all`, `dismissed`. <!-- copied from https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/vulnerability_findings.html --> |
